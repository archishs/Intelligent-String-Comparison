# Intelligent String Comparison
This is a program that uses Numpy to find the percentage of similarity between two strings, very similarily to how we as humans process the similarity. This is based off of an algorithm called the Levenshtein Ratio and Distance algorithm.

## Levenshtein Ratio and Distance Algorithm
This algorithm works to find a number called the Levenshtein distance, ultimately showing how many swaps two strings are from each other. This combined with synonyms is exactly how our human brains find the similarity between two pieces of text.

## Usage
To use this program yourself, ensure that you have Numpy installed, and you are set to use this program anywhere you need to.
